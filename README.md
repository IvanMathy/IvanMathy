### Howdy! I'm Ivan âœ¨

Welcome to my personal GitHub profile. Here you will find a few open source projects from over the years, some good, some not as much.

**If you're looking for my professional account, see [@IvanAtUptake](https://github.com/IvanAtUptake/)**

My most popular project is Boop. It's a small tool for MacOS that lets you run simple transformation scripts in your text. It's very fun to use and comes in handy surprisingly often.
